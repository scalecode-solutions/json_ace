# Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines our comprehensive testing approach for the `json_ace` development project. A robust testing strategy is critical to ensure that the new package works correctly while maintaining compatibility with `json_son` as its foundation.

## Testing Levels

### 1. Unit Testing

- **Scope**: Individual components, classes, and functions
- **Tools**: Dart test framework
- **Coverage Target**: 90%+ code coverage
- **Responsibility**: Developers implementing each feature

#### Key Areas for Unit Testing:
- Core conversion functions
- Annotation classes
- Configuration handling
- Code generation templates
- Strategy pattern implementations

### 2. Integration Testing

- **Scope**: Interaction between components
- **Tools**: Dart test framework with integration_test package
- **Coverage Target**: All component interactions
- **Responsibility**: Developers implementing integration points

#### Key Areas for Integration Testing:
- Class-level configuration with field-level annotations
- Code generation with annotations
- Integration with json_serializable and freezed
- Global configuration with local overrides
- Strategy pattern application

### 3. End-to-End Testing

- **Scope**: Complete workflows from JSON to objects and back
- **Tools**: Example applications with real-world data
- **Coverage Target**: All supported use cases
- **Responsibility**: QA team and developers

#### Key Areas for E2E Testing:
- Complex object hierarchies
- Edge cases with unusual data formats
- Performance with large datasets
- Error handling and recovery

### 4. Compatibility Testing

- **Scope**: Backward compatibility with existing code
- **Tools**: Migration test suite
- **Coverage Target**: All existing functionality
- **Responsibility**: QA team

#### Key Areas for Compatibility Testing:
- Existing DTOs with manual annotations
- Mixed usage of old and new APIs
- Migration paths for different features

## Test Automation

### CI/CD Integration

- Automated test runs on every PR
- Code coverage reporting
- Performance benchmarking
- Compatibility verification

### Test Data Management

- Maintain a repository of test JSON data
- Include edge cases and real-world examples
- Version test data alongside code

## Testing Timeline

Each phase of the refactoring plan will include its own testing cycle:

1. **Initial Testing**: Unit tests for new components
2. **Integration Testing**: As components are connected
3. **Regression Testing**: Before each release
4. **Performance Testing**: After functionality is complete

## Testing Roles and Responsibilities

- **Developers**: Unit tests and integration tests for their components
- **QA Team**: End-to-end and compatibility testing
- **Code Reviewers**: Verify test coverage and quality
- **Project Lead**: Ensure overall testing strategy is followed

## Test Documentation

- Test plans for each phase
- Test cases documented in code
- Test results reported in CI/CD
- Test coverage reports

## Special Testing Considerations

### Performance Testing

- Benchmark against current implementation
- Test with large datasets
- Measure memory usage
- Profile code generation time

### Error Handling Testing

- Test with malformed JSON
- Test with missing fields
- Test with incorrect types
- Verify error messages are helpful

### Cross-Platform Testing

- Test on different Dart/Flutter versions
- Test on different operating systems
- Test with different build configurations

## Test Reporting

- Automated test reports in CI/CD
- Weekly testing status updates
- Critical issues escalation process
- Pre-release testing summary

## Test Maintenance

- Regular review of test cases
- Update tests as requirements change
- Refactor tests alongside code
- Document test patterns and best practices
