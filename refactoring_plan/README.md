# JSON ACE Development Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for developing the new `json_ace` package (**J**ust **S**traightens **O**ut **N**onsense **A**nd **C**onverts **E**verything) that builds upon the foundation of `json_son`. Rather than refactoring the existing package, we'll create a new package that takes the core concepts to the next level while maintaining `json_son` as a standalone package.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create the `json_ace` package that builds on the foundation of `json_son` to address the following challenges:

- Reduce manual field-by-field updates
- Eliminate repetitive code
- Decrease maintenance burden
- Ensure consistency across the codebase
- Provide more powerful and flexible JSON conversion capabilities

While `json_son` will remain as a standalone package, `json_ace` will offer enhanced functionality with a more comprehensive approach to JSON handling.

## Implementation Phases

We've organized the development of JSON ACE into the following phases, in order of priority:

1. [Package Structure](./01_package_restructuring.md) - Creating the three focused packages (json_ace, json_ace_annotation, json_ace_generator)
2. [Class-Level Configuration](./02_class_level_configuration.md) - Implementing class-wide JSON conversion settings
3. [Type-Specific Annotations](./03_type_specific_annotations.md) - Creating targeted annotations for different data types
4. [Code Generation System](./04_code_generation_system.md) - Building the build-time code generation tools
5. [Integration with Ecosystem](./05_ecosystem_integration.md) - Integrating with json_serializable and freezed
6. [Global Configuration](./06_global_configuration.md) - Implementing project-wide settings
7. [Conversion Strategy Patterns](./07_conversion_strategy_patterns.md) - Creating reusable conversion strategies
8. [Advanced Features](./08_advanced_features.md) - Implementing additional enhancements

## Progress Tracking

Each phase has its own markdown file with detailed tasks, implementation notes, and progress tracking. Use the following status indicators in each file:

- üîÑ In Progress
- ‚úÖ Completed
- üîú Planned
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Blocked

## Testing Strategy

See the [Testing Strategy](./testing_strategy.md) document for our approach to ensuring quality throughout the refactoring process.

## Migration Guide

See the [Migration Guide](./migration_guide.md) for instructions on how to migrate existing code to use the new features.

## Timeline

See the [Project Timeline](./project_timeline.md) for estimated completion dates for each phase.

## Risk Management

See the [Risk Assessment](./risk_assessment.md) document for identified risks and mitigation strategies.

## Getting Started

To begin contributing to the JSON ACE development effort:

1. Review this README and the linked documents
2. Check the current status of each phase
3. Select a task that's marked as "Ready for Implementation"
4. Update the relevant documents as you make progress

Remember to keep all documentation up-to-date as the development progresses.

## Relationship with json_son

`json_son` will remain as a standalone package, focusing on its core functionality of flexible JSON conversion. `json_ace` will build upon these concepts but with a more comprehensive approach, including annotations, code generation, and advanced features. Users can choose to use either package based on their needs.
